# ðŸŽ¶ Spotify Game

Basic spotify game, users can create 'tables', which other users can join, then when the table creator starts the game, on the next heartbeat a random players will be selected and one of their top tracks is distributed amongst the table users. The song will be played for each player and song details will slowly be revealed. Players have to guess who the song 'belongs' to, the time at which the guess is recorded for a higher score.

TODO: Make game have multiple rounds,
TODO: Make the players have a score and leaderboard
TODO(potentially): make the server connection for table use websockets.
